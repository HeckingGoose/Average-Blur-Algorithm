# Average-Blur-Algorithm
**Built for Python 3+**
A Python-based blur algorithm that blurs an image by creating an average of every pixel within a set circular radius of a pixel, for every pixel in an image.

This algorithm is super slow, partly because it is built with Python, and partly because it's calculating a circle of pixels for every pixel in the image (which takes a while).

### To do:
- [ ] Fix bug where edges of image develop black-ish image
- [ ] Speed up blur algorithm
